## Summary
Are there attributes that we can measure that directly impact obesity levels in individuals? This study
will examine the consumption patterns and physical condition of individuals from three different
countries to predict the onset of obesity.
### Goals
This project explores one major goal:
1. Given an individual’s consumption habits, and physical characteristics, we should be able to group
them under categories that define different obesity levels.
#### Motivation and Background
Obesity stats, use metrics
According to Barquera from The Lancet, obesity has become a leading public health concern in
Mexcio. Obesity levels have been on the rise for the past 30+ years, with 25% or less of the adult
population having a weight that falls in the healthy BMI range (Barquera 2020). In Peru, according to
a study by Emma C Preston et al, childhood obesity begins within the 7-8 age group, with
prevalences between 19% and 8% (Preston et al 2015). Lastly, obesity prevalence in Columbia is
vastly increasing in urban residents. A study done aimed to assess changes in obesity levels in
Columbian adults between 2005 – 2010 showed that average BMI increased by 3%. Multivariable
analyses indicated various attributes such as sex, age, wealth etc have a positive affect on obesity
levels (Kasper et al, 2014).
For this project, I play the role of a data scientist examining the consumption patterns and physical
activity of various individuals from three different countries: Peru, Columbia, Mexico. My goal is to find
and group individuals that fall within the same attributes to determine which attribute plays a key
factor in increasing obesity levels.

###### Data Details
The dataset contains 2111 entries corresponding to 2111 different individuals. These individuals are
quantitatively analyzed using 17 different integer attributes. Examples of these attributes are stated
below:

Family History of Obesity
Weight
Height
Age
